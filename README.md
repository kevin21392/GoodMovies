# GoodMovies

Good Movies v1.0 

----------------

Welcome! Here is a simple web application that displays a list of movies and why they are good. Anyone can add, edit or delete the movies using this interface. This simple app was created to demonstrate how a REST api can be used to serve data to the front end.

The interface was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScipt to create a universal, mobile friendly display. The JavaScipt was utilized to alter the DOM to carry out the necessary functions. I'm sure as I learn more as a programmer, there would be an easier way to achieve this than the way that I did it. I understand that something like React would have worked better here, because you can create reusable components. My next goal is to learn React and use it to create an interface such as this, except it will allow users to log in and write and save notes to their personal notepads. There is just so much to learn and I am eager to learn. The only way to learn is it to do it!

As far as the backend API service, I have this connected to my hosted app on my website. This REST API is powered by Ruby on Rails running through Passenger on a LInux VPS. Ruby on Rails works great because of the speed in which you can create REST APIs. I have used Spring Boot and Java to create REST Apis in the past, but I like using Ruby on Rails better because of the speed, effectiveness, and scalability. I see myself using Rails in the future for more projects, although I'd be able to use other methods, too. I have never used Node and Express to create these API's, but I would be able to learn if necessary.
